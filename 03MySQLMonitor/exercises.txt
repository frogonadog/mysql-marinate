1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?
	Client-server architecure is a structure where one or more client apps communicate with a server (or multiple servers) to process data.  The client apps, such as browsers, send data to the server using various protocols.  The server will execute an app such as a database app to process the data and return data to the client app.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (We’ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)
Syntax:
SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
      [HIGH_PRIORITY]
      [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
      [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
      [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    select_expr [, select_expr ...]
    [FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [HAVING where_condition]
    [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
    [PROCEDURE procedure_name(argument_list)]
    [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
        [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
        export_options
      | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name'
      | INTO var_name [, var_name]]
    [FOR UPDATE | LOCK IN SHARE MODE]]

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/subqueries.html.

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
  must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
  rows. Its syntax is described in [HELP JOIN].

o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions
  that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an
  expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
  statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

  In the WHERE expression, you can use any of the functions and
  operators that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary)
  functions. See
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/expressions.html, and
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/functions.html.

SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?
	In interactive mode, the commands are keyed directly onto the command line, while in batch mode, the commands are coded in a file which is executed thru the SOURCE command.  This can make commands or series of commands that are use frequently easier to execute.

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?
	user identifies the user account connecting to the MySQL server
	password, if set for user, adds security for access to the server
	database provides a way to select the database to perform functions on
